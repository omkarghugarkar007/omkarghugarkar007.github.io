                <h2 class="mb-4">Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  I started with an introductory course on Udemy 
                  <br>
                  <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/"> Course Link</a>
                  <br>
                  This course gave me a feel of topics and made me ready for mastering the topics. I used leetcode platform for practising the question. 
                  <br>
                  Following link will help you to access all the questions
                  <br>
                  <a href="https://neetcode.io/practice">Neet Code</a> 
                  <br>
                  If you are stuck at a particular question, the YouTube video solutions would surely help you. Your aim should be to complete all the 150 questions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you are done with the intro, then the real practise begins. Following are the important topics.
                  <p>
                    <b>1. Array</b>
                    <br>
                    It is one of the easiest topic but still many coding test has a question related to array. This topic would not require any specifc YouTube playlist as such. Directly practising Needcode questions would do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>2. Two Pointer, Sliding Window and Intervals</b>
                    <br>
                    I would recommend to go through the Following YouTube playlist before trying the NeetCode questions. The topics are quite similar. 
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWeM8BDJmIYDaoQ5zuwyxnfj"> Aditya Verma Sliding Window</a>
                    <br>
                    You can first try the questions mentioned in the video than the Needcode questions. Most of the questions would be common. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>3. Stack, Binary Search and Heap</b>
                    <br>
                    Same approach as [2] can be followed.
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWdeOezg68SKkeLN4-T_jNHd">Aditya Verma Stack</a>
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWeYfhtuKHj-9MpYb6XQJ_f2">Aditya Verma Binary Search</a>
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWdtY9W22VjnPxG30CXNZpI9">Aditya Verma Heap</a>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>4. Linked List and Greedy</b>
                    <br>
                    Whatever you learnt in the Udemy course should be sufficient for you to do the NeetCode questions
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>5. Recursion</b>
                    <br>
                    Probably the most important topic. Following are the two playlists I recommend. You can go with anyone of them and then later try the backtracking section from NeetCode
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWeT1ffjiImo0sYTcnLzo-wY">Aditya Verma Recursion</a>
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgUwDviBIf0rGlzIn_7rsaR2FQ5e6ZOL9">Striver Recursion</a>
                  <p>
                    <b>6. Dynamic Programming</b>
                    <br>
                    You might be spending your most amount of time of this topic. Need to practice lots of questions. Following are the two playlists I recommend. Again, you can go with anyone of them but I would recommend to do both.
                    <br>
                    <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWekqhdCPmFohncHwz8TY2Go">Aditya Verma DP</a>
                    <br>
                    <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgUwDviBIf0qUlt5H_kiKYaNSqJ81PMMY">Striver DP</a>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>7. Trees</b>
                    <br>
                    BFS and DFS learnt in the Udemy course and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWfxJPz2-YKqL9gXWdgrhvdn"> DP on trees </a> would be sufficient for the NeetCode questions
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>8. Graphs</b>
                    <br>
                    One of the advance topics and usually done at the last. Following playlist would be more than sufficient.
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgUwDviBIf0oE3gA41TKO2H5bHpPd7fzn">Striver Graphs</a>
                  </p>
                <b>Disclaimer:</b>
                <br>
                These topics would actually not be sufficient to do all the questions in the coding test. Many CP related problems are also asked, though I found them more in Placement tests as compared to Intern tests. Such topics are infinite in nature and can only be applied to few questions. 
                <br>
                If you are able to complete the above 8 topics, more than 75% questions in the coding test would be easy for you then :)

                  <p>
                    Along with DSA, various other topics are very much essential. Mostly asked in interviews, but some companies can ask MCQ based questions or SQL queries. I would recommend to do this preparation parallel with DSA. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>1. SQL</b>
                    <br>
                    Many companies ask direct SQL queries in the placements test. I found that questions asked in the test are generally not very straight forward (though it is considered to be one one of the easiest topic) and a good practise of SQL queries is necessary. Many videos and playlists are available on YouTube. You can go with this <a href="https://youtu.be/HXV3zeQKqGY"> SQL</a>. You can practise questions on HackerRank or Leetcode but make sure to do "Joins" well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>2. CS concepts</b>
                    <br>
                    MCQ based questions possible in the tests. Direct concepts can be asked in the interviews. You can refer to the following series.
                    <br>
                    a. DBMS
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzeHZWIZsTpukecmA2p5rhHM14bl2dHU">Babbar DBMS</a>
                    <br>
                    b. Computer Networks
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxCzCOWd7aiGFBD2-2joCpWOLUrDLvVV_">GateSmashers CN</a>
                    <br>
                    c. Operating Systems
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzeHZWIZsTr3nwuTegHLa2qlI81QweYG">Babbar OS</a>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Major focus should be on DSA and SQL. Parellely, you can do these topics.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Does language matter for DSA?</b>
                    <br>
                    5-10% of companies would expect you to code in a specifc langauge, but except that you should go with the language of your convinence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Interview Preparation</b>
                    <br>
                    Before the interviews, you should try doing some mock interview rounds and have a habit of writing code using pen and paper. You should try to keep the interviewer involved in whatever you are thinking or writing on paper.

                    I am assuming you are not new to this field and have already done some prerequite courses like Andrew NG from coursera or some similar courses. You should also have some good projects on your resume. The interviews mostly revolves arounds the projects you have done and some basic Machine learning concepts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>ML concepts</b>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    2. SVM
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    You should be thorough with these topics. You can find various videos on these topics on YouTube. I would recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@krishnaik06">Krish Naik</a> for these topics.

                    One can expects the following questions.
                    <br>
                    1. What are the input and output of the model?
                    <br>
                    2. Which model was used? Why?

                    3. What was unique in this model?
                    <br>
                    4. What were your performance metrics and what you can do to improve this?
                    <br>

                    I would recommend to make a doc for each project in your resume which has details about the project and the answers to above questions.

                    Last but the most important, don't forget to prep for DSA and SQL questions. You will get many of them in the placement tests. Please refer DSA tab and SDE tab, respectively.
